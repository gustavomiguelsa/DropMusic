# DropMusic
Repo for the DropMusic project - Databases practice

In this project a colleague and I developed the frontend and backend of a music fileshare system, using standard web development techniques and MySQL. The website is no longer hosted on any server however, but the code is still valid.

Feel free to check through this code if it helps you get some ideas!
